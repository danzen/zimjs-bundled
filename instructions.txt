1. ZIM CODE
Update the normal ZIM with live/index.php 
Download the zim_test.js file with filezilla 
and copy from where it says:

// ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
// ZIM CODE

All the way down to the bottom to the end of exports.
And paste over the same code in src/zim.js 


2. TYPINGS
Go to the full editor of the code directory 
Go to typescript/parser/base.txt make adjustments 
Run the parser.html file in a browser and paste code into zim_ts/typings/zim/index.ts - look for red error
make changes to zim.ts - which can be .js but then tsup does not run properly so call it .ts 
STEPS:
    Add any new constants or globals to the top
    COPY from TYPES AND INTERFACES to the end of interfaces -> over into index.ts (overwrite same block)
    COPY from declare namespace zim to the end -> over into index.ts but leave the existing last line: export = zim 
the zim.ts can hold the docs version if desired


3. BUILDING
in the terminal, run: npm run build 
this will make the zim.js (node) and zim.mjs (es6) in the dist folder 

then, run: npm run web
this will make the combined version
